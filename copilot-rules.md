## ðŸš¨ Security: Never Upload Secrets
- Do not copy secrets into config files or chat.
- Use `.env.example` for safe placeholder variables.
- If a secret leaks, treat it as an incident: rotate, purge history, notify team.
## Primary Rule: NEVER Create Additional Files
- Do not create additional files unless and until explicitly asked to do so.
